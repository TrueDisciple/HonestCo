- Finished a lot of the base html and CSS for the page. 
- There were Issues with following the tutorial but overall I learned about the power of css and the mental awareness that comes with it.
    Mainly : z-layer: (Imagine layers in krita), :hover (Make the site appear dynamic), :active (same idea)
