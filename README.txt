A plan for my awesome website that is going to bring hundreds from all around.

The main idea
    - Hints of an ARG within the website
    - Useful to show of my talents with computer programming and design
    - Work me hard to make me a better programmer as time goes on

The Front page 
    - I want to have a clean dark themed page that uses my favorite shades of green. 
    - The front page will have the ability to show ads and let you log in
    - It will have the front of a nature company glorying the dark of the woods. (Camp fires, stars, tents, etc...)
    - the page will work effectivly on both firefox and chrome
    - Short videos can play and a cool underlay can be seen
    - secret files and messages can be found within textures or backgrounds


EXPEXCTATIONS:
    - I'll be able to run this from my own raspberry pi at home
    - I'll also make a database side where I can store some infromation for myself
    - I will learn to use react for the javascript portion of my programmer

Cost:
    - 50$ raspberry
    - 10$ per year domain name
    - 100+ hours of programming time

I will work on this project daily
I will have an initial draft of a page made before the 4th of JULY
