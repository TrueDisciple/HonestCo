- Finished a lot of the base html and CSS for the page. 
- There were Issues with following the tutorial but overall I learned about the power of css and the mental awareness that comes with it.
    Mainly : z-layer: (Imagine layers in krita), :hover (Make the site appear dynamic), :active (same idea)

- It appears the gliching was coming from my own slow computer and not the addition of additional images
    Despite this it is still cutting out some of my images and I need to have them be drawn on screen before moving them.
- Dope while it doesn't look exactly like the drawing I originally imagined this is still fairly cool!
- Image scaling and movement has been set and not only that but I had made a lot of progress.
- This Now needs some actual content and design. I am hoping to actually make a useful doc page below.
